# Automatic_Clothes_Drying_System_with_RTOS

**Tools:** Arduino IDE

**Description:**
- Designed and built a model using ESP32 and FreeRTOS for task scheduling and concurrency
- Integrated multiple sensors: DHT22 (temperature/humidity), light sensor (photodiode), rain sensor, limit switches
- Designed motor control using L298N driver and DC geared motor for automatic clothesline movement
- Implemented automatic and manual modes with time-tracking, fault detection, and buzzer alarm
- Applied FreeRTOS tasks, timers, mutex, and semaphores to manage sensor reading, motor control, error handling, and user input
